Increase customer trust and sales while reducing date-related support requests. Show your customers the estimated delivery date, from basic to elaborate configurations, on the product page, order process, and emails.<\/div>","additionalDescription":"<div><b>The importance of delivery dates cannot be overstated<\/b>, particularly for customers eager to spend their money in your store. This module assists you in assisting your consumers by providing features that make the overall purchasing experience of your customers easy and efficient.<\/div><div>\u00a0<\/div><div>When shopping online, you probably have found yourself wanting to know when a product will arrive more than once. There might be several reasons for this, such as that you need the product by a specific date or are eager to receive it... In all of these cases, <b>knowing the estimated delivery date of the product can influence your purchasing decision by increasing your trust in that shop and making you more comfortable and secure in making the purchase<\/b>.<\/div><div>\u00a0<\/div><div>From the owner\u2019s perspective, once configured, you will see a drop in all support inquiries relating to delivery dates (this has been verified by our clients numerous times) and an increase in the sales, making the investment completely worthwhile.<\/div><div>\u00a0<\/div><div>Internally, the module always attempts to separate its configurations into two modes: basic and advanced, making it possible to configure the module in 5 minutes while still allowing for complex configurations for those shops that require precise setups. This is possible because the module\u2019s features handle the preparation and delivery process as if it were real life.<\/div><div>\u00a0<\/div><div>To help you understand how it works, we've presented some of the features you\u2019ll find particularly helpful.<\/div><div>\u00a0<\/div><div><b>Geolocation: <\/b><\/div><div>The module uses unregistered users' geolocation to determine which carriers should be displayed for that customer. The customer's stored addresses will be used after they've logged in.<\/div><div>\u00a0<\/div><div><b>Display modes and customization: <\/b><\/div><div>Without editing a single line of code, a broad range of choices are available to simply define each parameter, such as style, time format, location, and colour of the Estimated Delivery information box.<\/div><div><b>Carrier-based configurations: <\/b><\/div><div>You can set all carrier parameters globally or individually for each carrier with the advanced options.<\/div><div><b>Global settings: <\/b><\/div><div>Date modification using global parameters such as categories, manufacturers, or suppliers<\/div><div>\u00a0<\/div><div><b>Product-based configurations: <\/b><\/div><div>When configured, they override the general settings, enabling you to change the delivery time of your items by utilizing the module's unique characteristics (picking days, out-of-stock additional days, release dates, available dates...). This can be accomplished at the product or combination level.<\/div><div>\u00a0<\/div><div><b>Orders and emails:<\/b><\/div><div>The Estimated Delivery date option can also be enabled during the order process. The date can be displayed optionally on the summary, in the carrier selection phase, and finally on the order confirmation page. When this functionality is enabled, clients and administrators may check the delivery date from the order history at any time.<\/div><div>Following the placement of the order, the delivery date can be included in the shop emails by adding a special variable on the templates.<\/div><div>\u00a0<\/div><div><b>Orders by picking (pickup dates):<\/b><\/div><div>A visual guide for determining which orders
