## About

**Sync your product catalog with Google**

Connect your store to Google Merchant Center and synchroniwe your entire product catalog in a few clicks. Product attributes such as price and availability will be automatically updated everyday.

## Building

This part covers the steps to get this project ready locally.

In order to run on a PrestaShop instance, dependencies needs to be downloaded and the JS application built.

### PHP

Retrieve dependencies with composer

```
composer install
# or
make docker-build-composer
```

Composer has been configured in authoritative mode, which means it won't look in the filesystem when a class is not found in the current autoloader.
When a class is added or deleted, it is required to rerun the above command.

### VueJS

The following commands need to be run in the `_dev/` folder.

To build the application in production mode:

```
npm install --n
npm run build

# or 

make vuejs
```

To compiles and watch for new changes (development mode):

```
npm install --n

npm run dev
```

## Testing

Tests will be run at each commit on this repository or any pull-request. These command reproduce the checks done by the CI.

* JS checks: Unit tests & coding standards

```
npm run lint
npm run test:unit

# or

make test-front
```

* PHP checks: Unit tests, coding standards...

```
vendor/bin/php-cs-fixer fix

vendor/bin/phpunit tests/

docker run -tid --rm -v ps-volume:/var/www/html --name temp-ps prestashop/prestashop; docker run --rm --volumes-from temp-ps -v $PWD:/web/module -e _PS_ROOT_DIR_=/var/www/html --workdir=/web/module phpstan/phpstan analyse --configuration=/web/module/tests/phpstan/phpstan.neon;

php vendor/bin/header-stamp --license=vendor/prestashop/header-stamp/assets/afl.txt --exclude=vendor,tests,_dev

# or

make test-back
```

## Environment customization

By default, PHP & JS will define data to the application that are related to the production.

In case you need to modify these variables while maintaining this project, you may
overwrite them in a freshly `.env` file created in the root directory of this module, by using the
keys that can be found in `classes/config/Config.php`.

If you want to use local vue app, set on your .env USE_LOCAL_VUE_APP at 1.
For instance to modify the base URL of the services for a local one:

```
PSX_MKTG_WITH_GOOGLE_API_URL=https://localhost:8080
PSX_MKTG_WITH_GOOGLE_API_KEY=API_KEY
USE_LOCAL_VUE_APP=1
```

Some values are managed by the Vue.js application and are provided in the [`_dev/.env` file](_dev/.env).


## Releasing

To publish a new version on the marketplace:
* Update the version in the main class of this module, and in `config.xml` ifit exists,
* Create a new release on the [releases page](https://github.com/PrestaShopCorp/pasmarketingwithgoogle/releases) with a tag that matches the version provided in the main class.
